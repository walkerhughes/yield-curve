# About

This is an unemployment passion project to study the yield curve and learn about TypeScript, Next.js, Google BigQuery, CI/CD, and general software development.

Loosely inspired by VixCentral.com, Yield Curve Central aims to be an informative, educational resource for everyday investors and economists. In all my searching 
the internet for comprehensive resources to learn about the role interest rates play in the economy, I was continually let down by the lack of resources available for the 
armchair investor. My hope is that this website helps bridge that gap and allows you to understand the yield curve and the role interest rates play in the macroeconomy.
