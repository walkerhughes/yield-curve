# How the Fed Influences the Yield Curve 

The US Treasury yield curve plots the interest rates of US Government bonds of different tenures over time. 
Studying the yield curve can give insights into the time-value of money and the level of perceived risk in the economy. 
The Federal Reserve Bank affects the interest rates seen here through their Federal Funds Rate, which is set every 3 months at their FOMC meetings. 
This overnight interest rate sets the tone for longer dated interest in the economy. 
Since the Fed meets in 3-month intervals to determine short-term rates, their effect on the yield curve is mostly felt in the yields tenured 3 months or less. 
Longer term yields are affected by another important factor called the **term premium**. Directly measuring an interest rate's term premium can be tricky, 
but analyzing the yield curve and the spreads between yields of different tenures can help elucidate how the aggregate economy views the riskiness of debt.
