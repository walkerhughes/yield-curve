    "TLDR": "\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe yield curve has been inverted for 710 days since July 5, 2022, signaling higher short-term interest rates compared to long-term rates, a potential indicator of slower economic growth or recession. The current yield values decline from a 3-month yield of 5.51% to a 10-year yield of 4.31%. Despite this inversion, the SPY ETF has performed well, indicating investor confidence in equities.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has kept the federal funds rate between 5.25% and 5.5% to balance employment and inflation goals. Although inflation has moderated, it remains above the Fed’s 2% target, leading to minimal expected rate cuts this year.\n\nOverall, the economic strategy combines cautious optimism among investors with careful monitoring and management by the Fed to handle inflation while supporting growth. The Fed’s approach suggests readiness to adjust rates if inflation remains high, aiming to achieve long-term stability at the 2% inflation target.\n"
