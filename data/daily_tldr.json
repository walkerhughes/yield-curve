    "TLDR": "\n**TL;DR**\n\nToday's US Treasury yield curve remains inverted, a condition since July 5, 2022, indicating economic concerns. The curve, where shorter-term yields exceed longer-term yields, traditionally signals potential slowdowns. The current 2-year and 10-year yield spread is 0.47%, while the 3-month and 10-year spread is 1.31%, suggesting expected medium-term economic weakening despite strong short-term data. Over the past month, 2-year yields stayed between 4.67%-4.93%, and 10-year yields fluctuated from 4.20%-4.55%, maintaining the inversion. The SPY ETF rose from $523.30 on May 14 to $542.45 on June 13, reflecting investor optimism in equities. The Federal Reserveâ€™s June 12, 2024 FOMC statement maintained the federal funds rate at 5.25%-5.5%, balancing job gains and easing inflation, but unlikely to cut rates until inflation trends towards their 2% target. Recent news of cooler inflation and lower Social Security COLA adjustments align with the Fed's cautious stance. The yield curve suggests a cautious economic outlook with the Fed likely to keep rates steady until inflation shows sustainable evidence of declining toward the 2% goal, despite robust equity performance.\n"
