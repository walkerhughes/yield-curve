    "TLDR": "\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe US Treasury yield curve has been inverted since July 5, 2022, with short-term yields higher than long-term yields, signaling economic uncertainty or a potential recession. The 2 Year-10 Year spread is 0.35% and the 3 Month-10 Year spread is 1.11%. Short-term yields are around 5.5% while the 10-year yield is about 4.36%, reflecting investor expectations of continued tightening conditions, as the Federal Reserve maintains the federal funds rate at 5.25%-5.50%. Despite the inverted curve, the SPY ETF has been rising, suggesting investor optimism due to economic growth and strong job gains. The Fed remains cautious, focusing on inflation and employment metrics before making any policy changes to avoid premature monetary shifts.\n"
