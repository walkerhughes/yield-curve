    "TLDR": "\n**TL;DR**\n\nAs of June 11, 2024, the US Treasury Yield Curve remains inverted for 709 days, with the 2-year yield 0.42% higher and the 3-month yield 1.13% higher than the 10-year yield, reflecting concerns over the economic outlook. The Federal Reserve aims to achieve maximum employment and 2% inflation but keeps the federal funds rate at 5.25%-5.5% due to ongoing high inflation. The yield curve signals an anticipated economic slowdown or recession, aligning with the Fed's efforts to cool the economy. The SPY ETF shows slight gains, indicating investor optimism, but CPI results and Fed meetings are crucial for future policy direction. Inflation trends from the CPI report will influence the Fed's decisions, potentially prompting a more dovish stance if improvements are seen. The Fed remains cautious, focusing on inflation control.\n"
