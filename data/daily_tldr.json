    "TLDR": "\n**TL;DR**\n\nAs of June 17, 2024, the US Treasury Yield Curve remains inverted for 715 days, typically signaling investor concerns about economic growth and potential recession. The 2-Year and 10-Year yields differ by 0.47%, and the 3-Month and 10-Year yields differ by 1.24%. Despite these concerns, the SPY ETF has shown an upward trend, suggesting investor optimism about corporate earnings. The Federal Reserve, in its June 12 statement, noted strong economic growth and job gains but persistent inflation above the 2 percent target. They maintained the federal funds rate at 5.25 to 5.5 percent, indicating future rate adjustments will depend on incoming data. Fed official Neel Kashkari mentioned a potential rate cut in December 2024, conditional on inflation progress. Overall, the yield curve inversion highlights market apprehensions, while the Fed remains cautious, focused on controlling inflation.\n"
